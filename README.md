For some reason Windows Defender decided to flag this as malware. I have no idea why (it might be becauee I get unique file ids to save Watch Time). I am currently trying to fix this being flagged, for now you can check the Source Code if you want to ensure that this is safe.


**This is a prototype.**

# Overview
This is a simple clean video player written in C#. This was made to make watching & following tutorials easier.
The player will float above any app,
currently I try to keep it to as little ui as possible and handle all interactions using hotkeys.
